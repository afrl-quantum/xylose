Author: Spencer E. Olson <olsonse@olsonse-laptop.(none)>
Date:   Tue Apr 13 15:15:30 2010 -0600

    Many additions due to CHIMP requirements.
    
    Imported:
        olson_tools::nsort
        olson_tools::distribution
        olson_tools::IteratorRange
        and other supporting pieces from olson_tools.
    
    Added a new Mersenne Twister random number generator.  This follows the same
    interface and implementation style as the other generators.

commit 3094011a823c1e9f65bba3a72d6a93608aed4205
Author: Spencer E. Olson <olsonse@asok>
Date:   Mon Apr 12 11:04:23 2010 -0600

    Added fix to support older GCC 3.2(.3) compiler which seemingly doesn't support
    using statments completely.

commit 4e8cc0e779914703384d843d178970f1319bfc37
Author: Spencer E. Olson <olsonse@asok>
Date:   Mon Apr 12 10:05:28 2010 -0600

    Fixed compiler problems for older GCC and PGI.
    
    GCC 3.2.X seems to understand the template disambiguation keyword differently
    than all the other compilers I have access to right now.  I'm not exactly sure
    what the standard dictates--it might be that the older GCC is slightly more
    correct.  At any rate, the new syntax used appears to be accepted by all other
    compilers I've tried (pathscale 3.2, GCC 4.1.2, GCC 4.4.?, Intel 11, PGI ?, IBM
    XL v?).

Date:   Wed Dec 30 16:28:55 2009 +0000

    Added a typed factory to instantiate subclasses of factory objects using a
    single parameter constructor.

commit 594601846fc8a078761096a7103ed7a893563cdc
Author: K. R. Walker <krwalker@stellarscience.com>
Date:   Tue Dec 29 22:34:15 2009 +0000

    Fix swap() implementation and usage on IBM VisualAge/xlC 8.0 and gcc 3.2 and 3.4:
      1. Added <xylose/Swap.hpp> which is a copy of <boost/utility/swap.hpp> with 's/boost/xylose/g' applied.
      2. Changed idiomatic 'using std::swap; swap(a,b);' to '::xylose::swap(a,b);'. This fully-qualified call moves the idiom to a common place (while also working around various compiler bugs) and also provides a workaround for IBM VisualAge/xlC 8.0. xlC always tries to call the member function even when a using declaration should make a nonmember name visible.
      3. Renamed Test_segmented_vector.cpp's 'swap' test case name to 'swapTest' to work around gcc 3.2 and 3.4's issue with ambiguous usage of swap (function vs struct constructor).
      4. Added nonmember swap for Stack and segmented_vector as suggested by Scott Meyers in Effective C++.
      5. Use xylose::swap for implementation of segmented_vector::swap(index,index) and swap(int,int).

    Added vector::swap feature to segmented_vector

commit c28af2be8291a5f4d713f50a62dc2e06d4d976c7
Author: K. R. Walker <krwalker@stellarscience.com>
Date:   Fri Dec 4 22:39:11 2009 +0000

    * Changed std::cout to BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE (moves out-of-band text to in-band for
      XML output).
    * Changed Time_segmented_vector's array insertion test to use a better
      reallocation algorithm. Although the original was simple and straightforward,
      on griffin, with mpich-gm, performing a realloc ever iteration proved to be
      extremely slow and would foul up the unit test system.

    tweaked bjam stuff to pull in boost_unit_test_framework directly

commit f5be23b455e199fc7041750de5ffe15d8778dfab
Author: Spencer E. Olson <olsonse@asok>
Date:   Fri Sep 11 22:52:53 2009 +0000

    Lots and lots of changes:
    
    1.  The random number generator has been moved into the xylose library.  The old
    Crappy generator was implemented in the newer generic framework and the
    testsuite completed successfully using this generator.  In the near future,
    we'll change a template parameter in the bottom of rand.hpp to switch to the
    new, more glorious, Kiss generator.
        Because the new generator classes generally have unsigned state vectors, I
    had to change the cell packing.
    Therefore:  RESTART FILES BUILT PRIOR TO THIS VERSION WILL NOT WORK ANY MORE!!!!
    Note again: RESTART FILES BUILT PRIOR TO THIS VERSION WILL NOT WORK ANY MORE!!!!
    
    2.  The xylose library has been overhauled in structure and in content.
        a.  There are several pieces that depended on olson-tools.  These pieces
        have been extracted out of olson-tools and inserted into the xylose library.
        b.  Traincars have been renamed 'segmented_vector' and moved into the xylose
        library.
    If you have new stuff for the xylose library, please remember to push it back into
    the mainline version.  The mainline version will retain build configuration
    files for both CMake and BJam, with CMake still being the officially supported
    build system.
