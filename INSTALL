Installation Instructions
*************************

This project uses both the Boost.Build and CMake system which separately
automatically track link, include, and other dependencies among any number of
libraries and projects.  You may use either the Boost.Build or CMake build
systems independently.  Below, you should find instructions for using either
Boost.Build, CMake, or a general system-style installtion.

Boost.Build:
  If you use Boost.Build, integrating this library into your own project is
  EASY.  No installation beyond storing Xylose somewhere on your harddrive.  To
  use Xylose in your Boost.Build project, you simply include a line like:

      use-project /xylose : path/to/xylose ;

  where the path/to/xylose path can be either relative or absolute.  
  This library has several sub-libraries that are useful and which will
  invoke the proper linking to external libraries as needed.

      /xylose//headers    : only provides <include> dependencies
      /xylose//xml        : invokes linking to the external libxml2 library.
      /xylose//xylose     : invokes linking to all xylose libraries and
                            dependencies.

  External libraries required by various components:
    libxml2
        This external library is only required for the /xylose//xml component.
        libxml2 should be installed somewhere on your system and the xml2-config
        command from that installation should be in your path.


CMake:
  CMake files also accompany the package and make it easier to use in a
  CMake environment.  To use in a CMake environment, just add appropriate
  lines to your master CMakeLists.txt file, such as

      add_subdirectory(xylose)

  You will also have to include the proper line for the include paths, such
  as:
      include_directories(
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/path/to/your/code
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/xylose/src
      )


General Install:
  These instructions are for installing this software into a standard layout
  where libraries are installed to  <prefix>/lib
  and headers are installed to      <prefix>/include
  DEFAULT:  <prefix> = /usr/local

  For a simple install, just do:
  
      bjam install
  
  To change the installation path, use
  
      bjam --prefix=/path/to/install/into/ install
  
  For help on other options, execute
  
      bjam --help


  External library installations required:
    physical
        If the <xml/physical_parse.h> header is needed.
    libxml2
        If <xml/*.h> headers are needed.
