/*
 * $Log: RKIntegrator.h,v $
 * Revision 1.1  2005/04/19 17:23:21  olsonse
 * Added new RKIntegrator wrapper class to allow for generic integration
 * templates.
 *
 * Also added trapfe library to help with trapping floating point exceptions.
 *
 * Fixed Distribution inverter finally (hopefull).  It no longer truncates the
 * distribution or reads from bogus memory.
 *
 * Added rk2 integrator (modified Euler) to rk.F.
 *
 * Various other fixes.
 *
