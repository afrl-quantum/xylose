/** \mainpage Xylose Utility Library API Documentation


<h3>Introduction</h3>
This library represents a collection of utility routines that are frequently
useful for larger computational projects.  The routines and data structures
defined in this collection do not perform any particular computational function
of themselves, but rather ease the implementation of such.  

Many of the routines included in this collection have associated examples, such
as
the \ref xml/simple.cpp "xylose::xml" interface,
the \ref timer/testTimer.cpp "xylose::Timer" class,
the \ref threadcache/easier/testPThreadEval.cpp "thread-cached task evaluator",
the \ref fit/appspack/file-io/prob-file-io.py "threaded APPSPack driver",
and so on.  In addition to the examples, nearly all
components have associated unit tests.  Often these unit tests can also be used
as tools for learning the associated routines.
